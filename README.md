- Hello, my name is Mike and I've been a software engineer for around a decade, primarily in web development.
- I started out writing automation scripts in Python and then transitioned to maintaining legacy back-end ASP.NET apps. For the last few years have been doing purely ReactJS front-end work.
- I’m constantly figuring out how to improve myself in the front-end while trying to stay informed about the back-end web practices.
